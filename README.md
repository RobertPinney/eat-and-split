Created in React and under the guidance of The Ultimate React Course on Udemy.
This single page app allows the user to add a friend by name while either including an image or generating a random image, thereafter the user can then split
a bill, and the app will keep track (using state) of who owes who how much money.

To do:
The app starts with 3 names from a provided array with pregenerated balances. Ideally the app would start blank.
Additionally there needs to be a button for removing a friend.
